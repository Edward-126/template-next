# Next.js Template by Edward Hyde

This Next.js template, created by Edward Hyde, is designed to kickstart your Next.js projects with essential dependencies and a foundation for building modern web applications using TypeScript. Simply run the following command to generate a new project:

```bash
npx @edwardhyde/template-next PROJECT-NAME
```

## Features

### Dependencies

This template includes the following dependencies commonly used in Next.js projects:

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive and custom designs with ease.
- **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React that enables developers to create smooth animations and interactions.

```

4. Start the development server:
